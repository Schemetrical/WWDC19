### BattleshipAR - A recreation of the classic game "Battleship" with ARKit for WWDC19 Scholarship Submission

Battleship was once a game played on pencil and paper, where the objective is to sink your enemies' ships are before they do.

This all time classic is now brought to you with ARKit 2 and Multipeer!

------

### Rules

1. You will need two people each with an iPad. One of you will be the *host* and the other will *join* the game.

2. First the host will set up a playing field.

3. Then, place your 5 ships onto your game board. Choose carefully, you will not be able to change the positions!

- Carrier: 5 units long
- Battleship: 4 units long
- Cruiser: 3 units long
- Submarine: 3 units long
- Destroyer: 2 units long

Note: If you have a hard time syncing world states, stop the playground and try again in a brighter area! *Both players should be able to place ships at the same time.*

4. Take turns bombing the other player's ships on their side of the board! You need to hit all parts of a ship to sink it. First one to sink the enemy fleet wins.

### Notes

Do not change the playground name (keep it the same between devices) - it will affect the module name too!

Some next steps to this would be to create 3D models to use in the scenes. Currently this playground exists as a proof of concept. Additionally, ships can currently overlap each other, but would be something to work on in the future!
